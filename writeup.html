            Our game consists of 3D objects - mainly bobsleds, tracks, and obstacles. We provide perspective views of our scene using the command "gluPerspective". The camera follows the bobsled as it races, so it moves based on the motion of the bobsled. 
          <BR>
            The main model for our gameplay is the bobsled model. The bobsled model is a struct defined in our scene that contains four separate mesh files -- a sled body, sled blades, helmets, and helmet masks -- all of which were modeled in Maya and exported as .OBJ files. Our scene reader was modified to support .OBJ files, also reading in texture coordinates. Each of these meshes is associated with its own material ID. Additionally, the bobsled contains a position and a velocity, which are updated according to the real time physical calculations, and 2 separate cameras. These cameras are a third and first person viewpoint, and they are transformed along with the sled. There are a few other fields used for tracking purposes.
          <BR>
            The other major models in our scenes are the track pieces. These were also modeled in Maya and exported. Each track piece consists of a polygonal semicircle that is extruded along a central axis. Each track piece stores information necessary for translating the sled. These include vectors pointing along the track, normals for the start and end, positions for the start and end, etc. There are 7 different types of tracks (straight, turns, approaches, and exits in each direction), and each could be tunneled. The bobsled can rotate all the way around a tunnel without falling off. The track was built by connecting a series of these track meshes and rotating them through space.

          Many objects in our scene are lit using OpenGL's lighting model. The bobsleds can be lit in this manner when they are not texture mapped. The helmets, ski masks, and obstacles are always lit using OpenGl's lighting model.

          Our game allows players to control their bobsled by steering left and right using the arrow keys (left and right). In addition, players can switch between first and third person view using the 1 and 3 keys, respectively. Finally, players can control the level of detail in their game using the + and - keys.

          Our game involves complex simulations of the physics that govern the motion of the bobsleds. It also includes various types of obstacles that aim at the bobsleds (for example, snowballs are dropped based on the location of the bobsled). These are discussed in greater detail below.

          Our game can be played using one of multiple different views. The default view is "third person" which places the camera at a fixed position relative to the bobsled (behind it and above). First person view is from the perspective of inside the helmet of the front bobsleder. Players can switch to first person view and back to third person view using the '1' and '3' keys.  Both cameras are stored within the Bobsled object and are transformed whenever the bobsled moves.
          
          We also tried splitting our screen and having two bobsleds running simultaneously to make the game multi-player. However, rendering the scene twice each frame cause it to slow down an unreasonable amount, so we limited our game to one player at a time.

          Our game includes an on-screen control panel. This control panel is generated by taking an orthographic projection of the track and bobsleds from above, using the command glOrtho. We also show the time in the control panel (how long the game has been running for). The time stops if/when you win or go off the edge of the track. It also announces "Player has Won!!" when a player completes the game.

          There are two types of obstacles in our game - rocks and snowballs. Rocks are stationary on the floor of the track. If you hit rocks, your bobsled shakes violently side to side, and you will slow down. Snowballs are not stationary and fall from the sky. They fall vertically but their initial left-right position is determined by the left-right position of the bobsled when the snowball is created, so if you do not move sideways to avoid them, they will hit you. When a snowball hits your bobsled, you slow down. Collisions between obstacles and bobsleds are determined by bounding box intersections, in order to avoid calculating time-consuming intersections between meshes. Once snowballs have fallen through the track, they are deleted so that we no longer have to update their position, check for collisions with them, or consider rendering them.
